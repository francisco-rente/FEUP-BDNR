I notice on two PC's on which I installed Trend Micro, that the computers boot up faster than they did with McAfee 2014.<br /><br />Since I would have had to pay postage to return this McAfee 2015, I decided to keep it as the price had been good. I will use this on a Windows 7 laptop which I have upgraded to the free version of Windows 10. Windows 10 includes Microsoft's antivirus program Defender which the reviews say is as good as the pay software. So, after the McAfee 2015 expires in a year, I will stick with Defender and Trend Micro.

It looks a bit like Pinterest with photos and articles to choose from, making that part of this software even more user-friendly than the rest of it.<br /><br />The Organizer is not my favorite part of the software, but only because I still struggle to use it effectively. There are tutorials at Adobe and on YouTube though, and I keep watching them!<br /><br />There are more artistic touches in 13 than in 12, and while many of the upgrades are subtle, I feel like the upgrade was worth it for the forty-five I paid for it. Certain features do tax your system a bit, so if you're using a PC with minimal RAM you may want to consider upgrading your PC's memory prior to using this, or any other photo editing software.<br /><br />I'm using this product on a Mac Mini running Yosemite (16GB memory) and a Windows 7 64-bit (16GB memory) PC. I've found it to be stable on both platforms, but I did run into an issue installing it on the Windows 7 PC - it stalled at 1% and I had to restart the PC and retry it to make it work. Since that time the software has been OK though, running without crashing or freezing. Two activations come with the product, and you can work with RAW files if desired.<br /><br />Overall, a very good product which can be used by beginners to experts. Guided and Expert modes, lots of 'Help' and fun features make learning this software less daunting than the full featured and much more expensive full Photoshop and Lightroom products, yet still provides a lot of room to grow.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/11/15<br /><br />I've enjoyed using this product, but found on my Windows 7 PC whether it was a fresh 13 install or an upgrade to 13.1, I'm missing 8 Facebook Cover themes. I've posted on the Adobe forum in an attempt to gain resolution of this issue, but thus far - that feature is a bust!<br /><br />On the 'upside', the edited photos I've produced have been great and the software is stable.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/18/15<br /><br />The Facebook Cover themes have finally shown up and are working as expected. I've increased my review rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />Also note that you have access to the full Adobe Creative Suite to try for FREE for 30 days with this software.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------rovides a lot of room to grow.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/11/15<br /><br />I've enjoyed using this product, but found on my Windows 7 PC whether it was a fresh 13 install or an upgrade to 13.1, I'm missing 8 Facebook Cover themes.

No disrespect meant here - I love and respect all animals, pigs included.I don\u2019t pass judgement harshly, but I feel this motto's meaning applies to digital art programs in general and to Corel Painter in particular.<br /><br />I've dabbled in drawing and painting for several years, and although I'm not particularly capable at either, I do know my way around pencils and brushes. Having read many glowing reviews that followed every release of Painter since before it was even a Corel app, I finally decided to try the app myself.<br /><br />I realized something was wrong right from the start when I tried drawing an even tone using Painter's pencils - I've done this so many times on paper that I could probably do it in my sleep! In Painter, though, all I could manage was a bunch of lines and marks that would get darker and darker and never really blend.<br /><br />I was certain I wouldn't have a problem with Painter\u2019s paint. I chose a grainy oil brush, picked a color, and started painting. Once again, I realized something wasn't right. With real media, I'd add paint to my brush only when I needed/wanted to. Painter's paint, however, would pile up with every new brush stroke. I figured I must have missed a setting that would make the brushes function more naturally. It turns out I was wrong - that's just how Painter works, and it can't be changed.<br /><br />I simply couldn't believe nor accept that Painter couldn't perform these two incredibly basic and essential tasks. Convinced I was doing something wrong, I scoured YouTube and user forums, and even emailed a few very helpful Painter experts. Incredibly, it turns out I was right all along - Painter, and most likely any other digital art app, simply can't emulate either of these tasks.<br /><br />So, back to piggy's lipstick...In my opinion, at least, all of Painter's fancy tools and effects are useless to me if I can't draw or paint naturally with them- it's like racing a car in a video game without steering or braking.

The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well, although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.

The WEN looks exactly like oscillating sanders offered for sale from other manufacturers, which I suspect means it's coming from the same factory in China that makes these for a different companies.  However, reading the specifications, this one reports to have a substantially more powerful motor than the others advertised at higher prices.  I can't speak to whether this is in fact true since I haven't purchased the others.  The WEN isn't that heavy, but the base is flat and didn't vibrate when placed on my workbench.  Clamped to the workbench it was virtually vibration free. I guess if you're doing really detailed work you might want something a lot heavier, but I suspect if that's the kind of work you need to do that you already know you're going to need a much more expensive sander than this one.<br /><br />Having built in storage is really nice, though I wish they had also thought to add a place to store the wrench that comes with it for removing the spindle nut.  It's also really helpful that supplies for this sander are easy to get - there is nothing proprietary about this sander.<br /><br />One thing I especially like is that the dust collector port is a standard one.

When they get to town..they find the maid dead, and everyone in town missing or dead...so the sheriff who is played by Ben Afleck and his crew show up. The best character to me is Deputy Stu Wargle..who is played by Liev Schreiber. If you know Lievs laugh and roles..you'll know what I mean. He makes me giggle every time he laughs. He fits this character well, imo. Anyway, the movie is OK. I got it fast and in good condition, so good seller.

The film opens with Zarkorr emerging from a California mountainside and frightening the locals. In a piece of editing that about breaks your neck, the action shifts to the Newark apartment of postal worker Tommy Ward (Rees Christian Pugh) who is greeted by a holographic &#34;teenage mall tramp&#34; materializing next to his cereal bowl, Proctor (Torie Lynch), who informs him that the monster is a test from an advanced civilization and that he is the sole human who can defeat him as they have identified him as the most average human on Earth. She warns him (while speaking directly to his cerebral cortex!) that Zarkorr is a 180-foot tall horned fire-breathing dinosaur who will home in on him, so he can't simply flee. While speaking in riddles she gives one key hint: &#34;Zarkorr contains the key to his own destruction&#34;.<br /><br />Tommy's initial instincts seem poor, as they involve a ridiculous kidnapping of a cryptozoologist, Stephanie (DePrise Grossman), although this does pay off in a hilarious three-way police standoff that firms up the storyline a bit. The protagonists flee to the lair of &#34;cybernaut&#34; Arthur, one of the most antisocial characters in memory (for a good guy), and lots of boredom ensues. Indeed, the biggest negative of the film is that there is precious little Zarkorr on display, and a lot of scenery-chewing distractions. I particularly commend the filmmakers for the bit of social commentary in which they have a pro-Zarkorr lawyer arguing that we can't harm him under the Endangered Species Act. Sadly, this bit of satire is even more relevant today than it was when this was made in 1996.<br /><br />If you do not wish to know the big secret Proctor alluded to in Tommy's Newark apartment, this would be a good time for you to stop reading this review: there's a costume change and a road trip to Arizona to find Zarkorr's off switch (I swear this is a plotpoint). There's intermittent lame city trampling, and the climactic scene in which Tommy must face Zarkorr one on one.<br /><br />Will Tommy save the world? Will he run for President? Will he ask Stephanie out? I won't answer those questions, but I will say that &#34;Zarkorr The Invader&#34; is an amusing parody of the famous Japanese kaiju movies that may have some tedious patches, but is an amusing and unusual departure from the normal Full Moon catalog.swear this is a plotpoint).
